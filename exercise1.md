	    In a hypothetical situation involving a team of 6 maintaining an active application written in C, many steps are taken in Continuous Integration for development speed and seamless teamwork. 
	    While many C programmers opt to use compiler flags to for syntax checking or linting, it can be supplemented with Clang-Tidy, even with GCC. For testing, one can use asserts and autotools or Cmake to implement a make check with small unit tests. However, if the project requires a testing framework, one can use gtest by Google or Unity. Building can be accomplished with GCC or Clang. These tools can be then ran within a docker container with the necessary tools installed providing a clean build environment. One can also use a shell-executer, which negates the aforementioned benefit. 
	    GitLab provides an open source CI/CD runner tool which can be hosted on GitLab itself, however the free tier only allows 5 users. But one could self-host and forgo customer support by GitLab. A simple YAML configuration file is used to configure the pipeline, which defines the stages and jobs. Each stage, such as the build and testing stages, contains multiple jobs which execute in order to satisfy requirements. These are executed many times a day to check each commit of each team member to prevent conflicts and problems down the line. 
	    As previously mentioned, GitLabâ€™s runner can be ran by GitLab itself with GitLab SaaS tiered subscription plan. It can also be hosted on a third party service. Self serving the whole system would require two hosts, one for the runner and one for GitLab CE. It all depends on budget and the size of the project.
	    Using these tools, software development can be faster and more efficient with the improvement to workflow and mitigation of future issues.
